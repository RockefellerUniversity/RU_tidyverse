Rough plan:

What is tidy data?
Many of us taught BaseR. Which is great. Tidyverse is a collection of tools that make data wrangling easier.

some of the tools:
readr – reading tabular data into a data frame in R
tidyr – tools for creating tidy data frames
dplyr – a consistent set of verbs for solving most data manipulation challenges
ggplot2 – a system for declaratively creating plots based on the Grammar of Graphics
stringr – string matching, extraction, replacement and joining operations

Whare we doing today?
Introduce workflow. What is the workflow for analyzing data in a tidy way?
Introduce dataset. Go from messy dataset. Superimpose examples of how we tody data and produc outputs onto model.

Visualization with GG plot.
Gradually build up the ggplot.
Make it pretty.
Maybe start with an ok dataset. Secon dstep is an even messier dataset. Similar overlapping data. could then integrate them togtehr?

Interacting with tidyr:
filter - filter rows
arrange - arrange rows
select - select columns
mutate - add new variables
groupby and summarise - get summary information

any merging type behaviour?

pipes to put these things together. put many commands together. end in a plot.


What are we working with? Tibble vs data frame. Reintroduce this idea of tidy data.
Creation of dataframe versus tibble.
Benefits of tibble. ver dataframe.
Conversion

Loading/Writing data


more advanced ggplot. building models. lots of slf directed progress.








Desired dataset:
Small bio dataset
Untidy
Make it tidy
